# Next Step

Install and set up React Router for navigation between recipe list and detailed recipe views.

This task involves:

1. Installing the React Router DOM package
2. Setting up the basic router configuration in the application
3. Creating a routes structure for the main page and individual recipe detail pages
4. Implementing navigation between the recipe list and detail views

This step is a prerequisite for implementing the RecipeDetail component, as it will provide the navigation structure needed to move between the recipe list and individual recipe details. It follows the Single Responsibility Principle by focusing only on navigation setup, with the actual RecipeDetail component implementation to follow in the next step.
