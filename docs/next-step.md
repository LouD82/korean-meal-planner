Implement Print and Share Functionality for Grocery Lists and Recipes

This task involves:

1. Creating a print-friendly stylesheet for recipe and grocery list pages
2. Implementing functionality to generate PDF versions of grocery lists and recipes
3. Adding share options (email, copy link) for grocery lists and recipes

This focused implementation task will improve the usability of the application by allowing users to easily print or share their grocery lists and recipes. It addresses the practical need for users to have offline access to their meal planning materials when shopping or cooking.
