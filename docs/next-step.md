# Next Step

Implement Grocery List Optimization to Reduce Duplicate Ingredients.

This task involves:

1. Enhancing the grocery list generation functionality to combine duplicate ingredients and similar items
2. Creating a utility function that aggregates ingredient amounts with the same name
3. Implementing unit conversion for compatible measurements (e.g., combining 1 tbsp and 2 tsp of the same ingredient)

This focused implementation task improves the grocery list feature, addressing a key issue observed in the current implementation - multiple occurrences of the same or similar ingredients that should be combined. This enhances the user experience by providing a more organized and efficient grocery list, better supporting the project goal of simplifying meal planning and preparation.
