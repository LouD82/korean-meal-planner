# Next Step

Create the RecipeDetail component to display comprehensive recipe information when a recipe card is clicked.

The RecipeDetail component should:

1. Display all recipe details including name, image, type, description, preparation time, cooking time, servings, ingredients list, and preparation steps
2. Include the batch cooking instructions for the recipe
3. Be properly styled with Tailwind CSS
4. Implement a way to navigate back to the recipe list view 
5. Set up proper routing using React Router or a similar navigation mechanism if needed

This step follows the implementation of the RecipeCard component and will allow users to view full recipe details, which is essential for the meal planning application. This adds the ability to transition from browsing recipes to viewing detailed information about a selected recipe.
