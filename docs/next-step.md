Implement Print and Clipboard Functionality for Grocery Lists.

This task involves:

1. Implementing the Print List button functionality to allow users to print their grocery list
2. Implementing the Copy to Clipboard button functionality to allow users to copy the grocery list to their clipboard
3. Adding appropriate feedback to users when the copy action is successful

This focused implementation task will enhance the usability of the grocery list feature by allowing users to easily print their shopping list or copy it to their clipboard, supporting the project's goal of facilitating meal planning and preparation.
