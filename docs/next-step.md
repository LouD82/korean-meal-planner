# Next Step

Implement recipe search and filtering functionality

This task involves:

1. Adding a search bar component to allow users to search for recipes by name, ingredient, or meal type
2. Implementing filtering functionality to filter recipes based on criteria like meal type (lunch/dinner), preparation time, or cooking time
3. Updating the Recipes page to display filtered results
4. Ensuring the search/filter is responsive and user-friendly

This focused task will enhance the user experience by making it easier to find specific recipes, especially as the recipe collection grows beyond the current 7 recipes. The search and filtering functionality is a natural next step in the application's evolution since we now have a significant number of recipes that would benefit from improved discoverability.
