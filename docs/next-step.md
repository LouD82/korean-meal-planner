# Next Step

Implement the Meal Plan Generation Functionality

This task involves:

1. Creating a meal plan generation feature that allows users to automatically create weekly meal plans based on their preferences
2. Implementing functionality to customize meal plans, including recipe selection and rotation
3. Integrating this meal plan generator with the existing meal plans page and user settings

This focused implementation task directly addresses the core project goal of providing a rotating selection of lunch and dinner options for the week. It builds upon the previously implemented user settings and preferences, recipe display, and meal plan infrastructure to deliver a complete meal planning experience.
