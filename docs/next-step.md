# Next Step

Create a RecipeCard component to display recipe information. This task involves:

1. Create a new component file at `/src/components/recipes/RecipeCard.tsx`
2. Implement a React component that displays key recipe information including:
   - Recipe name
   - Recipe image
   - Short description
   - Preparation and cooking time
   - A way to view more details (placeholder for now)
3. Style the component using Tailwind CSS to create an attractive, user-friendly card layout
4. Update the App.tsx file to import and use the RecipeCard component for displaying available recipes

This component will serve as a fundamental building block for displaying recipes throughout the application. Creating this component first will allow us to visualize and interact with the recipe data we've already created, and it will be reused in multiple parts of the application including the recipe list and meal plan sections.
