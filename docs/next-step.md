# Next Step

Create a RecipeDetail component to display detailed recipe information. This task involves:

1. Create a new component file at `/src/components/recipes/RecipeDetail.tsx`
2. Implement a React component that displays comprehensive recipe information including:
   - Recipe name, image, and type (lunch/dinner)
   - Full description
   - Preparation and cooking time
   - Ingredients list with amounts and units
   - Step-by-step cooking instructions
   - Batch cooking instructions
   - Servings information
3. Style the component using Tailwind CSS to create a clean, user-friendly layout
4. Update the App.tsx file to conditionally render this component when a recipe is selected

This component will provide users with detailed information about each recipe, including ingredients and cooking instructions. Creating this component next builds on the RecipeCard implementation from the previous session, enabling users to view the complete recipe details when they click on a recipe card.
