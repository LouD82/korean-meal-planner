# Next Step

Implement the RecipeDetail component to display comprehensive recipe information.

This task involves:

1. Enhancing the existing RecipeDetailPage component to display all recipe information
2. Creating a structured layout to display:
   - Recipe ingredients with quantities and units
   - Step-by-step cooking instructions
   - Batch cooking instructions
   - Serving information

This is a focused implementation task that builds on the existing RecipeDetailPage structure, making use of the recipe data model that's already in place. It will provide users with complete recipe information when they click on a recipe card, which is a core requirement of the application as outlined in the project specs.
