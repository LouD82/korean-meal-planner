# Next Step

Create the recipe data JSON file based on the researched Korean recipes. This task involves:

1. Create a JSON file in the `/public/data/` directory to store recipe data
2. Convert the researched recipes (Kimbap, Ground Beef Bulgogi, Bibimbap, and Doenjang Jjigae) into JSON format following the TypeScript type definitions established in `src/types/recipe.ts`
3. Include all recipe details such as ingredients, steps, and batch cooking instructions

This step will provide the necessary data structure for rendering recipe components and implementing the meal planning functionality in future steps. Having real recipe data will allow us to build and test components with actual content instead of placeholders.
