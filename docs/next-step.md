# Next Step

Implement User Settings and Preferences Functionality

This task involves:

1. Creating a settings page where users can customize their meal planning experience
2. Implementing features such as setting dietary preferences, servings adjustments, and user interface preferences
3. Adding persistent storage for these settings using local storage

This focused implementation task will enhance the application's personalization capabilities, allowing users to customize their meal planning experience. It addresses the "intuitive user interface" objective from the project outline and expands on the functional features already implemented, making the application more adaptable to individual user needs.
