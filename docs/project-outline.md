# Project Outline: Korean Meal Planner

## Original Project Idea

Please create an app that recommends Korean dishes for lunches and dinners throughout the week. I am currently using a meal delivery service (Hungryroot), but would like to ditch that for the money savings of going to a supermarket. Specifically, in this case, I'd like to replace it by shopping at H-Mart, a Korean grocery in my area. The meals should be VERY easy to make, and ideally I could prepare them in a large batch on Sundays, before the week begins. I don't need a lot of variety, maybe each week could be a batched lunch, batched dinner, and each could rotate through 3-4 options, changing each week. In other words, maybe one week I could batch a particular lunch and a particular dinner that I would eat throughout the week, then the next week that would change to a different lunch and dinner, and there could be 3-4 each that rotate through. I'm not married to that, but it's a place to start. The app should show recipies and make a grocery list for me. Thank you!

## Project Name and Overview

The Korean Meal Planner is a web application designed to help users replace meal delivery services with home-cooked Korean meals using ingredients from H-Mart. The application focuses on easy-to-prepare recipes that can be batch-cooked on Sundays for the upcoming week, offering a rotating selection of lunch and dinner options (3-4 each). The application provides detailed recipes and automatically generates grocery lists based on the selected meal plan.

This project aims to simplify meal planning and preparation while helping users save money by transitioning from meal delivery services to home cooking with affordable, delicious Korean recipes. The target audience is individuals looking to streamline their meal planning process, save money on food, and enjoy Korean cuisine without spending extensive time cooking daily.

## Key Goals and Objectives

- Provide a rotating selection of easy-to-prepare Korean lunch and dinner recipes suitable for batch cooking
- Allow users to view weekly meal plans with a different lunch and dinner option each week
- Display detailed recipes with ingredients, instructions, and batch cooking guidance
- Generate comprehensive grocery lists based on the selected meal plan
- Create a simple, intuitive user interface that requires minimal interaction

## Technical Scope

The Korean Meal Planner will be implemented as a client-side web application using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, with Vite as the build tool. The application will primarily rely on client-side rendering and local browser storage for saving user preferences and selected meal plans. This approach eliminates the need for a backend server while still providing a responsive and interactive user experience.

The application will include a predefined set of Korean recipes specifically selected for ease of preparation and suitability for batch cooking. These recipes will be stored as structured data within the application, allowing for dynamic meal plan generation and grocery list compilation.

## Success Criteria

- Users can view a weekly meal plan with rotated lunch and dinner options
- Each recipe includes clear instructions and ingredient lists optimized for batch cooking
- Automatic generation of grocery lists based on the selected meal plan
- Intuitive navigation between meal plans, recipes, and grocery lists
- Mobile-responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will begin with research into simple Korean recipes suitable for batch cooking, followed by creating a structured data model for recipes and meal plans. The frontend development will focus on creating reusable React components for displaying meal plans, recipes, and grocery lists, with an emphasis on a clean, intuitive user interface.

The project will be developed incrementally, starting with the core functionality of displaying recipes and generating meal plans, followed by the grocery list generator and any additional features. A GitHub repository will be set up for version control, with GitHub Pages used for deployment of the static site.
