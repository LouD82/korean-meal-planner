# Session 8 Summary

## Accomplished

- Analyzed the current project state by reviewing project outline, session guide, research guide, and most recent session summary
- Reviewed the existing code structure including App.tsx, recipeUtils.ts, and type definitions
- Confirmed that the recipe data JSON file and placeholder images were successfully created in Session 7
- Determined that creating the RecipeCard component is the logical next step
- Updated the `/docs/next-step.md` file with detailed instructions for creating the RecipeCard component
- Updated the session guide with a summary of this session's accomplishments

## Current Project State

- The project has a complete data foundation with:
  - Type definitions for recipes and meal plans
  - A structured JSON file containing four Korean recipes
  - Placeholder images for each recipe
- The basic App component structure is set up with placeholders for meal plan and recipe displays
- Utility functions for handling recipes and meal plans are defined but need to be updated to use the JSON data
- The project is now ready for UI component implementation, starting with the RecipeCard component
- Next step is clearly documented in `/docs/next-step.md`

The application development is now transitioning from data preparation to UI component implementation. The RecipeCard component will be the first visual element that displays the recipe data, serving as a fundamental building block for the user interface.
