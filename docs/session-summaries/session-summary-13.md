# Session 13 Summary

## Accomplished

- Implemented functionality to allow users to select a meal plan as their current active plan
- Created a localStorage-based persistence mechanism to save the user's selected meal plan across browser sessions
- Developed a reusable MealPlanDisplay component for consistent UI across the application
- Enhanced the MealPlansPage to include "Select as Current Plan" buttons for each meal plan
- Updated the HomePage to prominently display the currently selected meal plan
- Created a custom hook (useCurrentMealPlan) to centralize meal plan selection logic
- Added visual indicators to clearly identify the current meal plan
- Implemented utility functions for local storage operations
- Updated the recipeUtils to use local storage for retrieving the current meal plan
- Visually verified the functionality works correctly across page refreshes

## Challenges Encountered

- Testing local storage persistence required careful verification across browser sessions
- Needed to ensure proper state management between the HomePage and MealPlansPage
- Had to handle cases where no meal plan has been selected
- Ensuring visual consistency between the meal plan display on different pages
- Managing component reuse while allowing for different functionality on different pages

## Current Project State

- Users can now select a meal plan as their current active plan
- The selected meal plan persists across browser sessions using local storage
- The HomePage prominently displays the currently selected meal plan
- The MealPlansPage shows which plan is currently selected and allows changing the selection
- The application has improved user experience with a more interactive interface
- The foundation is in place for implementing additional meal plan features

## Visual Verification Results

Visual verification confirmed that:
- Week 1 initially displays as the current plan by default
- The "Select as Current Plan" button appears for Week 2
- After selecting Week 2, it receives the "Current Plan" indicator
- The HomePage correctly updates to show Week 2 as the current plan
- After refreshing the browser, the selected plan remains saved (Week 2)
- The styling clearly indicates which plan is currently selected
- All navigation between pages maintains the correct selected meal plan state

The current meal plan selection and local storage functionality has been successfully implemented, allowing users to customize their experience by selecting different meal plans that persist between sessions.
