# Session 10 Summary

## Accomplished

- Reviewed the project's current state, including:
  - Project outline and goals
  - Previously completed work through session-guide.md
  - Most recent session summary (session-summary-9.md)
  - Research guide for recipe research
  - Current implementation of the RecipeCard component
  - Current implementation of the App.tsx file
  - Recipe data structure and utility functions
- Analyzed the logical progression of the application based on what has been implemented so far
- Determined the next logical step in development: creating a RecipeDetail component
- Updated the `/docs/next-step.md` file to document the specific task to be executed in the next session

## Challenges Encountered

No significant challenges were encountered during this session as the focus was on analyzing the current project state and determining the next step.

## Current Project State

- The project has a functioning RecipeCard component that displays recipe information in a grid layout
- Recipe data is properly loaded from a JSON file
- The application has a solid foundation for displaying and interacting with recipes
- The next logical step (creating a RecipeDetail component) has been clearly documented

## Next Development Focus

The next development session should focus on implementing the RecipeDetail component, which will:
- Display comprehensive recipe information
- Show ingredients and step-by-step instructions
- Include batch cooking guidance
- Provide a detailed view when users click on a recipe card

This component will enable users to view all the information they need to prepare the recipes, which is a core functionality of the meal planning application.
