# Session 10 Summary

## Accomplished

- Installed React Router DOM package to enable navigation between different views in the application
- Created a router configuration in `/src/router.tsx` with routes for:
  - Home page
  - Recipes list page
  - Recipe detail page
  - Meal plans page
  - Grocery list page
- Set up a Layout component to provide a consistent structure across all pages
- Created a Navigation component for navigating between different sections of the app
- Migrated the App component's content to individual page components:
  - `HomePage.tsx` - Main landing page
  - `RecipesPage.tsx` - List of all available recipes
  - `RecipeDetailPage.tsx` - Detailed view of a specific recipe
  - `MealPlansPage.tsx` - Weekly meal plans display
  - `GroceryListPage.tsx` - Grocery list generation
- Updated the main.tsx file to use the router provider instead of directly rendering the App component
- Implemented navigation between pages using React Router's navigation hooks
- Tested all routes and verified that navigation works correctly using Stagehand
- Committed and pushed all changes to GitHub

## Challenges Encountered

- Had to reorganize the application structure to accommodate the new routing system
- Created placeholder content for pages that will be fully implemented in future steps
- Ensured that the recipe detail navigation worked correctly with URL parameters
- Made sure the layout was consistent across all pages in the application

## Current Project State

- The application now has a fully functional navigation system using React Router
- Users can navigate between different sections of the application
- The Recipe cards now navigate to individual recipe detail pages when clicked
- The application has a consistent layout with a header, navigation bar, and footer
- All routes are properly configured and loading the correct components
- The foundation is in place for implementing the RecipeDetail component in the next step

## Visual Verification Results

Visual verification with Stagehand confirmed:
- All navigation links in the top navigation bar work correctly
- Clicking on recipe cards navigates to the recipe detail page
- The back button on the recipe detail page returns to the previous view
- The layout is consistent across all pages
- The recipe detail page shows a placeholder indicating where the detailed content will go
- The meal plans page displays the weekly meal plans with their corresponding recipes
- The grocery list page shows a checklist of items needed for the selected meal plan
