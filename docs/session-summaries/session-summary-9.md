# Session 9 Summary

## Accomplished

- Created a new RecipeCard component in `/src/components/recipes/RecipeCard.tsx` that displays:
  - Recipe name
  - Recipe image
  - Recipe type (lunch or dinner) with appropriate badge styling
  - Short description of the recipe
  - Preparation and cooking time information
  - A "View Recipe" button for future navigation to recipe details
- Updated the `recipeUtils.ts` file to load recipes and meal plans from the JSON file
- Modified the App.tsx file to display a grid of recipe cards using the new component
- Installed and configured Tailwind CSS for styling the application
- Added event handling for recipe selection (currently just console logging)
- Attempted to visually verify the component using Stagehand but encountered technical issues
- Successfully committed all changes to GitHub

## Challenges Encountered

- Discovered that Tailwind CSS was not installed in the project and had to add it
- Encountered issues with the npm `tailwindcss init` command, so manually created the configuration files
- Had to update the RecipeCard component to use `truncate` instead of `line-clamp-2` for better compatibility
- Encountered issues with Stagehand for visual verification, which prevented us from confirming the visual appearance

## Current Project State

- The project now has a functioning RecipeCard component for displaying recipe information
- The application can load recipe data from the JSON file created in the previous session
- Basic styling is implemented with Tailwind CSS
- The main application grid shows all available recipes in a responsive layout
- The foundation for user interaction with recipes is in place

## Next Steps

The RecipeCard component is now implemented, but we weren't able to visually verify it due to technical issues with Stagehand. In a future session, we should:

1. Visually verify the RecipeCard component's appearance
2. Implement a RecipeDetail component for showing full recipe information when a card is clicked
3. Create the MealPlan component to display the current weekly meal plan

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for these future enhancements.
