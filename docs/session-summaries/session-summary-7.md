# Session 7 Summary

## Accomplished

- Created the recipe data JSON file in `/public/data/recipes.json` based on the researched Korean recipes
- Structured the recipe data according to the TypeScript type definitions established in `src/types/recipe.ts`
- Included all recipe details for Kimbap, Ground Beef Bulgogi, Bibimbap, and Doenjang Jjigae
- Added details such as ingredients, preparation steps, and batch cooking instructions for each recipe
- Created a `/public/images/` directory to store placeholder images for each recipe
- Created placeholder image files for each recipe (kimbap.jpg, ground-beef-bulgogi.jpg, bibimbap.jpg, doenjang-jjigae.jpg)
- Added two weekly meal plans in the JSON file to demonstrate the rotation of lunch and dinner recipes

## Current Project State

- The project now has a structured data source (`/public/data/recipes.json`) that can be used by the React components
- Recipe data includes detailed information about ingredients, steps, and batch cooking instructions
- The data follows the established TypeScript type definitions, ensuring type safety when used in the application
- Placeholder images have been created for each recipe
- Weekly meal plans have been defined to demonstrate the rotation of recipes
- The project is now ready for the next step, which would likely involve creating components to display the recipe data

All required recipe data is now available in the application, providing a foundation for building the user interface components that will display recipes, meal plans, and grocery lists.
