# Korean Dinner Recipes for Batch Cooking - Part 1

This document contains research on two Korean dinner recipes suitable for batch cooking, focusing on simplicity, ingredient availability at H-Mart, and minimal preparation time.

## Recipe 1: Bibimbap Meal Prep Bowls

### Overview
Bibimbap (비빔밥), meaning "mixed rice," is a beloved Korean dish consisting of rice topped with seasoned vegetables, protein, and a spicy gochujang sauce. This meal prep version simplifies the traditional recipe while maintaining its nutritional balance and flavors, making it perfect for batch cooking and enjoying throughout the week.

### Key Benefits for Batch Cooking
- Components can be prepared separately and assembled when ready to eat
- Vegetables retain texture and flavor when stored properly
- Can be customized based on seasonal availability and preferences
- Most components stay fresh for 3-5 days in the refrigerator
- Ingredients readily available at H-Mart

### Ingredients (Makes 4-5 servings)
- 4 cups cooked short-grain rice
- 8 oz (220g) lean ground beef or thinly sliced beef
- 2 cups spinach, blanched and seasoned
- 1 large carrot, julienned and sautéed
- 1 medium zucchini, julienned and sautéed
- 1 cup bean sprouts, blanched and seasoned
- 4-5 eggs (for fried eggs, one per serving)
- Sesame oil for cooking
- Sesame seeds for garnish
- Green onions, chopped for garnish

#### Beef Marinade:
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp minced garlic
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp grated ginger

#### Gochujang Sauce:
- 3 tbsp gochujang (Korean red pepper paste)
- 1 tbsp sugar or honey
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp water
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tsp minced garlic

### Preparation Method (Batch Cooking Approach)
1. **Rice preparation:** Cook rice according to package instructions. Allow to cool completely before storing in airtight containers.

2. **Protein preparation:**
   - Mix all marinade ingredients in a bowl.
   - Add ground beef or sliced beef and marinate for at least 15 minutes.
   - Heat a pan over medium-high heat, add the marinated beef, and cook until browned (about 5-7 minutes).
   - Set aside to cool completely.

3. **Vegetable preparation (prepare each separately):**
   - Spinach: Blanch in boiling water for 30 seconds, drain, rinse with cold water, and squeeze out excess moisture. Season with 1 tsp sesame oil, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1 tsp minced garlic.
   - Carrots: Sauté julienned carrots in 1 tsp sesame oil for 2-3 minutes with a pinch of salt.
   - Zucchini: Sauté julienned zucchini in 1 tsp sesame oil for 2-3 minutes with a pinch of salt.
   - Bean sprouts: Blanch in boiling water for 2 minutes, drain, rinse with cold water. Season with 1 tsp sesame oil, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1 tsp minced garlic.
   - Allow all vegetables to cool completely.

4. **Sauce preparation:**
   - Mix all gochujang sauce ingredients in a bowl until well combined.
   - Portion into small containers or reusable sauce packets.

5. **Assembly for batch cooking:**
   - Option 1 (Components separated): Store rice, cooked beef, and each vegetable in separate containers. This preserves the textures best but requires more containers.
   - Option 2 (Partial assembly): Divide rice among meal prep containers. Add beef and arranged vegetables on top, keeping each component separate. Store sauce separately. Do not mix until ready to eat.
   - For both options, eggs should be fried fresh when ready to serve.

6. **Storage for batch cooking:**
   - Refrigerate all components in airtight containers for up to 4-5 days.
   - The sauce will keep for up to a week refrigerated.
   - For extended storage, rice, beef, and blanched vegetables can be frozen separately for up to 2 months.

### Serving Instructions
1. If components are stored separately, assemble the bowl with rice on the bottom, vegetables arranged on top, and beef in the center.
2. Heat the assembled bowl in the microwave for 1-2 minutes if desired.
3. Fry an egg (sunny-side up is traditional) and place on top of the heated bowl.
4. Drizzle with gochujang sauce, sprinkle with sesame seeds and green onions.
5. Mix everything together thoroughly before eating.

## Recipe 2: Doenjang Jjigae (Korean Soybean Paste Stew)

### Overview
Doenjang Jjigae is a hearty, comforting Korean stew made with fermented soybean paste (doenjang), tofu, and vegetables. It's a staple in Korean cuisine and perfect for batch cooking as the flavors actually improve after a day or two, making it ideal for weekly meal preparation.

### Key Benefits for Batch Cooking
- One-pot preparation for easy cleanup
- Flavors develop and improve over time

### Ingredients (Makes 4-5 servings)

### Preparation Method (Batch Cooking Approach)
1. **Prepare the base:**
   - Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat.
   - Add onions and garlic, sautéing until translucent (about 3-4 minutes).
   - Add potatoes and cook for 2-3 minutes.

2. **Build the stew:**
   - Add water or stock to the pot and bring to a boil.
   - Reduce heat to medium-low and add doenjang paste, dissolving it into the broth.
   - If using gochujang, add it now and stir well.
   - Add zucchini and mushrooms, simmer for 5 minutes.
   - Add tofu cubes carefully to avoid breaking them.
   - Simmer for another 10-15 minutes until potatoes are soft and flavors are well-combined.
   - In the last minute of cooking, add green onions and Korean chili pepper if using.

3. **Cool properly for storage:**
   - Allow the stew to cool completely before transferring to storage containers.
   - Divide into portion-sized containers for easy reheating.

4. **Storage for batch cooking:**
   - Refrigerate: Store in airtight containers for up to 5 days. The flavor will actually improve after the first day!
   - Freeze: This stew freezes very well. Portion into freezer-safe containers and freeze for up to 2 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before reheating.

### Reheating Instructions
- Stovetop (preferred method): Transfer to a small pot and heat over medium heat for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally.
- Microwave: Heat for 2-3 minutes, stirring halfway through.

### Serving Suggestion
Serve hot with a side of fresh steamed rice and kimchi. The traditional way to enjoy this stew is to have a spoonful of stew followed by a bite of rice.
