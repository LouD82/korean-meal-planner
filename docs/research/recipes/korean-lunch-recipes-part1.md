# Korean Lunch Recipes for Batch Cooking - Part 1

This document contains research on two Korean lunch recipes suitable for batch cooking, focusing on simplicity, ingredient availability at H-Mart, and minimal preparation time.

## Recipe 1: Kimbap (Korean Seaweed Rice Rolls)

### Overview
Kimbap is a popular Korean dish consisting of rice, vegetables, and sometimes meat, all rolled in seaweed. It's an excellent option for batch cooking as you can prepare multiple rolls at once and store them for daily consumption throughout the week.

### Key Benefits for Batch Cooking
- Can be prepared in advance and refrigerated for 2-3 days
- Portable and ready-to-eat (no reheating needed)
- Versatile ingredients allow for customization based on preferences
- Ingredients are readily available at H-Mart

### Ingredients (Makes 4-5 rolls, approximately 5 servings)
- 3 cups cooked short-grain rice
- 5 sheets of seaweed (gim)
- 1-2 carrots, julienned
- 1 cucumber, julienned
- 3-4 eggs, beaten (for egg strips)
- 1 package of pickled yellow radish (danmuji), cut into strips
- Optional protein: imitation crab sticks, cooked beef bulgogi, or spam
- 2 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp salt
- 1 tbsp sesame seeds
- Bamboo rolling mat

### Preparation Method (Batch Cooking Approach)
1. **Rice preparation:** Cook rice according to package instructions. While still warm, mix with 1 tbsp sesame oil and 1 tsp salt. Allow to cool slightly.

2. **Vegetable preparation:**
   - Julienne carrots and saut√© for 2-3 minutes with a pinch of salt. Set aside to cool.
   - Julienne cucumber, sprinkle with salt, and after 5 minutes, squeeze out excess water.
   - Beat eggs with a pinch of salt, make thin omelets, and slice into strips.
   - Slice pickled radish into strips.

3. **Assembly:**
   - Place a sheet of seaweed on a bamboo mat, shiny side down.
   - Spread about 3/4 cup of rice evenly over the seaweed, leaving a small border at the top.
   - Arrange fillings in lines across the center of the rice.
   - Roll tightly using the bamboo mat, applying gentle pressure.
   - Brush the finished roll with a little sesame oil for shine and flavor.
   - Slice each roll into 8 pieces with a sharp knife.

4. **Storage for batch cooking:**
   - For immediate consumption (1-2 days): Wrap each whole roll tightly in plastic wrap before slicing and refrigerate.
   - For longer storage: Keep the rolls uncut, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, then foil, and refrigerate. Slice only when ready to eat.
   - Don't freeze kimbap as the rice texture will deteriorate.

### Serving Suggestion
Serve with a small container of soy sauce mixed with a drop of sesame oil for dipping if desired.

## Recipe 2: Ground Beef Bulgogi Meal Prep Bowls

### Overview
This simplified version of traditional bulgogi uses ground beef instead of sliced beef, making it much easier and quicker to prepare. When portioned into meal prep containers with rice and vegetables, it creates a complete, balanced meal that reheats beautifully throughout the week.

### Key Benefits for Batch Cooking
- Cooks in one pan for easy cleanup
- Freezes excellently for longer storage
- Reheats well without texture changes
- Cost-effective using ground beef instead of traditional sliced beef
- Ingredients readily available at H-Mart

### Ingredients (Makes 4-5 servings)
- 1 lb ground beef (preferably 85-90% lean)
- 1 onion, finely diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 green onions, chopped (white and green parts separated)
- 8 oz mushrooms, finely chopped (optional)
- 4 cups cooked rice (for serving)
- 2 cups broccoli florets (or other vegetables of choice)

#### Bulgogi Sauce:
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp mirin (rice wine) or apple juice
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp grated ginger
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds
- Optional: 1-2 tsp gochujang (Korean chili paste) for some heat

### Preparation Method (Batch Cooking Approach)
1. **Rice preparation:** Cook rice according to package instructions. This can be done while preparing the beef mixture.

2. **Vegetable preparation:** Steam broccoli florets until just tender (about 4-5 minutes). Immediately rinse with cold water to stop cooking and set aside.

3. **Bulgogi sauce:** In a bowl, mix together soy sauce, brown sugar, mirin, sesame oil, grated ginger, black pepper, and gochujang (if using).

4. **Cook bulgogi:**
   - Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.
   - Add ground beef and break it apart with a spatula as it cooks.
   - When beef is halfway cooked (still some pink), add diced onion, minced garlic, mushrooms (if using), and white parts of green onions.
   - Continue cooking until beef is fully browned and vegetables are soft.
   - Pour in the bulgogi sauce and stir well to combine. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.
   - Stir in half the sesame seeds and the green parts of the green onions.

5. **Assemble meal prep containers:**
   - Divide cooked rice among 4-5 meal prep containers.
   - Top with a portion of the beef bulgogi mixture.
   - Add a portion of steamed broccoli to each container.
   - Sprinkle with remaining sesame seeds and green onions.

6. **Storage for batch cooking:**
   - Refrigerate: Allow containers to cool before securing lids. Store in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.
   - Freeze: These bowls freeze well for up to 2 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before reheating.

### Reheating Instructions
- Microwave: Heat for 2-3 minutes, stirring halfway through if possible.
- Stovetop: For best results when reheating from refrigerated (not frozen), empty contents into a small pan and heat over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

## Evaluation for Batch Cooking Suitability

Both recipes have been selected specifically for their batch cooking potential:

### Kimbap
- **Prep complexity:** Medium (requires multiple components but each is simple)
- **Storage duration:** Best within 2-3 days refrigerated
- **Reheating needs:** None (served cold)
- **Taste preservation:** Excellent when stored properly
- **Cost efficiency:** High (basic ingredients that can be varied based on budget)

### Ground Beef Bulgogi Bowls
- **Prep complexity:** Low (one-pan main component)
- **Storage duration:** 4 days refrigerated, up to 2 months frozen
- **Reheating needs:** Simple microwave or stovetop reheat
- **Taste preservation:** Excellent, flavors often improve after a day
- **Cost efficiency:** High (uses ground beef instead of more expensive cuts)

Both recipes fulfill the requirement for easy preparation, batch cooking capability, and ingredient availability at H-Mart.
